# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Challenge
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to determine if the length of a campaign contributes to it's ultimate success or failure. 
According to the data gathered from the “outcomes based on goals”, the higher the goal the less successful the campaign. The lower the goal, the more successful the campaign was. The most successful campaign’s had a goal between $1,000 and $4,999. Also when reviewed, the “outcome based on the launch date” according to the data, the best time for a release is in the month of May. Therefore I would suggest Louise to launch her campaign in May and have a goal of no more than $5000.
